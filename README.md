# remote-work-analysis

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling on a remote working survey dataset. The analysis aims to uncover insights about remote working trends, preferences, and challenges, and to build models that can predict relevant outcomes based on the survey data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a survey on remote working, which includes various responses related to remote working experiences, preferences, productivity, and challenges.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melodyyiphoiching/remote-working-survey)

## Objective
